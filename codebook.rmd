## Project Description
This project creates a tidy data set from a raw untidy data set

##Study design and data processing

###Collection of the raw data
Data was downloaded from the following link:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 


###Notes on the original (raw) data 
Some additional notes (if avaialble, otherwise you can leave this section out).

##Creating the tidy datafile

###Guide to create the tidy data file
The steps used in creating the tidy data file were as follows:
1.  First the data was downloaded and loaded into R:
    - The train data set and corresponding labels
    - the test data set and corresponding labels
2.  The train data and test data were then merged.
3.  Column labels were attached to the data
4.  The columns that corresponded to mean and standard deviation values were then extracted.
5.  Then the data was summarised.

###Cleaning of the data
Short, high-level description of what the cleaning script does. [link to the readme document that describes the code in greater detail]()

##Description of the variables in the tiny_data.txt file
General description of the file including:

 - Dimensions of the dataset
 The dataset contains 68 variabes with 180 rows of data.

 - Summary of the data
 The first variable Activity represents what activity took place: 
    WALKING
    WALKING_UPSTAIRS
    WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
    SITTING
    STANDING
    LAYING

The subject variable represents the individual that performed the activity.
The other 66 variables represents various measurements while the subject was preforming the activity

- Variables present in the dataset are as follows:

Sources you used if any, otherise leave out.

##Annex
If you used any code in the codebook that had the echo=FALSE attribute post this here (make sure you set the results parameter to 'hide' as you do not want the results to show again)
